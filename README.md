2019_06_17_modLog2FC_ouch.R - R commands to get moderated log2 fold change (R package "DESeq2") from DHS-seq data and run Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (R package "ouch"). DESeq2 is used to transform count data into a continuous distribution for OU models. OU models are used to fit selective regimes on the tips of the tree. Best model is chosen by AIC comparisons and significant deviation from Brownian motion. 

2019_07_18_modLog2FC_ouch.R - R commands to get moderated log2 fold change (R package "DESeq2") from DHS-seq data and run Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (R package "ouch"). DESeq2 is used to transform count data into a continuous distribution for OU models. OU models are used to fit selective regimes on the tips of the tree. P-values calculated with likelihood ratio tests (LRT) between OU and BM model. Benjamini-Hochberg correction is used to correct for LRT P-values for each set of OU models (i.e. for each selective regime). Best model is chosen by lowest FDR and significant deviation from Brownian motion.
